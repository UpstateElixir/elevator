# Elevator

A fun project for Upstate Elixir members to learn and play with OTP. Inspired
by [Greg Vaugh's talk at ElixirConf 2014](http://confreaks.tv/videos/elixirconf2014-elixir-elevated) and the
[corresponding repository](https://github.com/gvaughn/elixir_elevated)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `elevator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elevator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/elevator](https://hexdocs.pm/elevator).
